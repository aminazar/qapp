History
=======
This file explains the decisions and steps I took in this project that are not necessarily reflected in VCS.

Version Control System
----------------------
30 May 2016: I chose to use Git with [a github public repository](https://github.com/aminazar/qapp/).

Technical details:

    `> cd quran_app/`
   
    `> git init`
   
    `> git add README.md`
   
    `> git commit -m "first commit"`

    `> git remote add origin https://github.com/aminazar/qapp.git`
   
    `> git push -u origin master`

### `.gitignore`
Added webstorm and npm modules - plus an extension used in Mac. Learnt from James Shore.

### Licence
I used Creative Commons zero as license - for now.
